# TorrentBD Theme Engine

The theme engine for TorrentBD is a userscript/add-on that lets you customize the color palette of the TorrentBD website. Updates are first released on GreasyFork, then on the supported add-on stores.

#### This is not supported, sponsored, or endorsed by TorrentBD or TorrentBD staff.

## Introduction

TorrentBD Theme Engine uses JavaScript to dynamically change the CSS (and some HTML) of the TorrentBD website. It is made with only that one website in mind, so a large part of the script would have to be modified when applying to any other site.

The script uses localStorage to save color values in the browser, and connects them with CSS variables to allow users to change any color as they please. It is a simple application, but the code might be crude. I'm still learning.

## Downloads

You can download either the UserScript version or the Extension/Add-on version at your convenience. UserScript version is updated first.

[TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is needed to install the UserScript from GreasyFork. Other similar extensions may also work.
