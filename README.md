# TorrentBD Theme Engine

The theme engine for TorrentBD is a userscript that lets you customize the color palette of the TorrentBD website. Updates are first released on GreasyFork, then on the supported extension stores.

#### This is not supported, sponsored, or endorsed by TorrentBD or TorrentBD staff.

## Introduction

TorrentBD Theme Engine uses JavaScript to dynamically change the CSS (and some HTML) of the TorrentBD website. It is made with only that one website in mind, so a large part of the script would have to be modified when applying to any other site.

The script uses localStorage to save color values in the browser, and connects them with CSS variables to allow users to change any color as they please. It is a simple application, but the code might be crude. I'm still learning.

## Install

TamperMonkey is needed to install the UserScript from GreasyFork. Other similar extensions may also work but have not been tested.

#### (1) Install TamperMonkey for your browser

## Uninstall

Simply disable to remove the script from the dashboard of your script manager. If you don't understand how that works, uninstall the TamperMonkey extension instead.
